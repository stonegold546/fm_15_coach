# fm_15_coach

You've probably got here by mistake, [this app](https://fm-15-coach.herokuapp.com/) is for a football simulation game (**football manager**) I play.

I use this to calculate the stars of the coaches in the game given their attributes.

*Tomorrow*, I might split this into an API and a View...

I didn't get the underlying calculations through my effort, I got them from some spreadsheet. I think this is it -> [Downloads: Hoe goed is een trainer?! Kijk het na!](http://forum.manutd.nl/downloads.php?do=file&id=18).

The idea to check FM print outs came from [FMScreener](http://www.fmscreener.com/). Upon semi-completion of this, I realized they do the same exact multiple coach search. Basically, this is a watered-down replica of what they've done and theirs is in multiple languages. Well, I've done this already so...
